chroma_server.py

This script would normally start a local ChromaDB server to manage
embeddings and perform vector searches.  For the purposes of this
demonstration it simply prints a message and exits.  In a real
application you might import chromadb, create a persistent
collection and expose an API over HTTP or gRPC.
